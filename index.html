                Learning cultural etiquettes of Canada is not only polite, but a great way to feel integrated into Canadian society. 
                Simple gestures can show your dedication to adapting to a new culture. We’ll have a list of some common ac to help you get started.

                Canadians are well known for their politeness and “you live your life, I’ll 
                live mine” type of attitude.
           
                      As long as individuals are respectful to one ano
                ther, Canadians tend to have
                 an open mind regarding social interactions. <br><br> 

                 Another important aspect to remember is how to act during snow days. 
                If your house is in front of the sidewalk, it is customary to shovel the sidewalk in front of your house. 
                By making a cleared path on the sidewalk, other people are able to walk without getting snow in their boots.
                Not only is your sidewalk cleared, these little acts of kindness make Canadian snow days a bit more bearable during the winter.
